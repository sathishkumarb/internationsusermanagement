user_update                         POST       ANY      ANY    /users/{id}/update


To delete the user with id as get parameter (there is a validation if a member of a group)
user_delete                         GET        ANY      ANY    /users/{id}/delete


To remove the user from group

To delete the group
group_delete                        GET        ANY      ANY    /users/{id}/deletegroup

fos_user_group_new                  GET|POST   ANY      ANY    /group/new
fos_user_group_show                 GET        ANY      ANY    /group/{groupName}
fos_user_group_edit                 GET|POST   ANY      ANY    /group/{groupName}/edit
fos_user_group_delete               GET        ANY      ANY    /group/{groupName}/delete
```


## Notes

```
EasyAdmin with sonatabundles is readily available but i did not go with that approach.
 
FOSUSERBUNDLE is overridden and customer user group controller created along overrding fosuser

HTTP PUT & DELETE was not handled via form might be a slight security breach here due to time constraints in edit and delete routes

PURE FOS_USER_BUNDLE + Symfony 4 Rest based auth + API creation can be done following the link below

Please dont hesitate to compliant a bug or feedback
